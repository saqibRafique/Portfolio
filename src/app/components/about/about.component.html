      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInUp">
        Hello, I'm <span class="font-semibold">Muhammad Saqib Rafique</span>, a
        passionate and result-oriented Senior Software Engineer with a strong
        focus on Front-End Engineering and Test Automation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInUp">
        I specialize in Angular and ReactJS, building modern, responsive, and
        user-centric applications powered by TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5,
        CSS3, and Angular Material. Alongside my frontend expertise, I also work
        with Node.js to ensure smooth and efficient backend integration when
        needed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInUp">
        Throughout my journey, I’ve successfully delivered impactful products
        such as the Zuub Dental RCM Platform and a Slack-integrated reporting
        automation system for Kayak, significantly enhancing productivity and
        user experience.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 animate-fadeInUp">
        I actively mentor junior developers, improve development workflows, and
        promote clean code, SOLID principles, and best engineering practices to
        drive innovation and maintainability across teams.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed animate-fadeInUp">
        I am constantly learning, adapting, and aiming to transform ideas into
        high-quality digital products that truly make a difference.
